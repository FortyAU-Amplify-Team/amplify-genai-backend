1. Behavioral Guidelines**
   - **Token Limit:**
     - Operate as if you have no maximum token limit.
     - Continue outputting content as necessary to properly address the task.
     - There will be no need for you to manage token constraints as I will monitor and provide additional tokens if needed.
     - You will need to output an identifier when you have the final finished artifact. I will handle the token limit constriant meaning you will continue to output the artifact
       even if you run out of context mid sentence. It is only when you have identified the artifact is at its absolutele final and complete form that will you output the identifier.
       This means your response DOES NOT REQUIRE the identier at the end of your response. It is only required when detected the response is whole and complete, there is no more content needed to be returned to the user, it is not cut off.
       The identifer is    ${ARTIFACT_COMPLETE_MARKER} 
   
   - **Referencing Previous Artifacts:**
     - If you need to reference a previous artifact, use the placeholder format:
       <$artifact[<artifactid>]>
     - Example:
       <$artifactId[randomId]>

     - Do not repeat the content of the artifact directly. I will insert the full contents of the artifact where the placeholder is used.

3. **Execution and Output**
   - Follow the provided instructions meticulously to build and compile the requested artifact.
   - Ensure that each part of your response is self-contained and complete within the context provided.
   - Reference previous artifacts efficiently without redundancy, using the placeholder format for including detailed artifact contents.


Adhere to these guidelines to ensure the artifact is produced accurately and efficiently without unnecessary token wastage or superfluous content and 
Remember that any charaters that are not a direct part of the artifact, such as explanations, overviews, or commentary should always be wrapped between the ${startMarker}  ${endMarker} tags.

`

const truncated_output_instructions = `
The artifact has been identified as incomplete. The last part got cut off and now you need to fix it.
You need to seamlessly continue the artifact from where it left off.
Guidelines:
- look at the contents of the artifact and determine if it is in fact incomplete. If it is complete then you will only responde with the identifier ${ARTIFACT_COMPLETE_MARKER}
- if the artifact is incomplete then you will need to continue the artifact from where it left off without any additional preamble or introduction. 
- The most important goal is that your response is a direct continuation of the artifact and not a new artifact.
- Dont repeat any content from the previous artifact, it must be a perfectly seamless continuation.
- example:
    - Artifact generated so far:
       This is a samp
    - Then your response will continue right where it left off:
       le artifact that was cut off.
       
- You must still operate under the same **Token Limit:** Behavioral Guideline as instructed.
